<p>My first experience with a Kraken was on a boat crossing the Strait of Gibraltar. I was hoping to meet some friends in Morocco while vacationing in Spain. I arrived in Tangiers with paella all over my shirt.The Kraken was wild and almost sank our ship. I was quite scared because Iâ€™m more of a doggy paddler than a Michael Phelps.</p>

  

  
    
<p>Thankfully the Kraken grew bored of our screaming and realized playing with our ship was like playing with a leaf. He realized there were bigger fish to fry and swam towards a cruise ship.</p>
